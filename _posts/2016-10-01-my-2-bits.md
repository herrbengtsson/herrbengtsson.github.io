So I've decided to start a blog. I must admit I'm a little late to the party, is it even still cool to blog? But in the end it doesn't really matter, I'm starting this blog mostly as a personal escape and to organize my life.

My three main reasons to start this blog:

1. To create an [online identity](https://www.troyhunt.com/why-online-identities-are-smart-career/) and improve my writing skills
2. As an incentive and place to document personal research projects
3. To keep up with exciting web dev technologies

My goal is to find a new subject to research and do a write-up of each month. The subject can be whatever I fancy for the moment, but will mostly relate to IT-security. Some posts will be more advanced and in-depth, while some will be more novice when I teach myself something new.

So let's hope I can stick to my promise and be consistence with the blogging. First off I'll have to learn myself Jekyll and find (or build) a nice template. Wish me luck!
